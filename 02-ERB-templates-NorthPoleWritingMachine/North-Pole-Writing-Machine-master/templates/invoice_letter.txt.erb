Attention: <%= name.capitalize %>'s Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name.capitalize %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name.capitalize %>'s Toy Order
=================
<% toys.each do |toy| %>
$<%= toy == "Kaleidoscope" ? "0    Kaleidoscope (out of stock)" : "#{toy_price}  #{toy}" -%>
<% end %>
----
$<%= sub_total %>  Subtotal
$<%= hst.round %>   HST
====
$<%= total.round %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= total.round %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name.capitalize %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
