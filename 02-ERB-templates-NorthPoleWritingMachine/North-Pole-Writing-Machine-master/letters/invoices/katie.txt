Attention: Katie's Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Katie's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

Katie's Toy Order

$100  Robot
$100  Slinky
$100  Clue
$100  Meccano
$100  Sorry
$100  Stickers

$600  Subtotal
$78   HST
====
$678  Total

Your total comes to $678. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Katie's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
